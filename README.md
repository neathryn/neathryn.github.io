## CODING AND 3D MODELING COMMISSIONS CLOSED

Experienced in Java, Python, and Lua. Semi-introduced to C++ and, Ruby (learning more thoroughly).

I'm currently taking time from 3D modeling commissions to focus on better repologized 3D models using Blender and higher quality custom textures

My Discord is @rlji for inquiries.
