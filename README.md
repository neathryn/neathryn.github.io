welcome to my site
Hi, I’m Neath
I’m experienced in Java, Python and, I'm currently learning C++
also somewhat experienced in Ruby.
While I have experience in coding, I also have experience in:
3D Modeling
Designing - - mainly architecture wise
and plan to put them to use in the future with internships - - I have
been learning code since 2021 with the help of LeetCode.
I am currently not taking commissions, so my contact button is not here.
However, my discord is neath6067 for inquiries. :)
